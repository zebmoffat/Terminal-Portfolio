    Hi, I'm Zeb! I'm a software engineering junior at Arizona State University. I was first introduced to coding
    in high school with a small html/css website project. I thought it was cool, but soon forgot about it. My 
    original major in college was Computer Information Systems, where we started learning the basics of Python.
    I quickly fell in love with programming and the logic necessary to build something with it. Now I am a junior
    in software engineering and haven't looked back!
